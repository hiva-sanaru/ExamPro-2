## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#2E9AFE) for trust and focus. Derived from the serious and important context of examinations.
- Background color: Light blue (#EBF5FF). Same hue as the primary, but very desaturated for a calm feeling, with high brightness for a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#9B51E0) to provide a contrasting highlight for important interactive elements. Analogous to blue, and with sufficient separation in brightness/saturation.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body. 'Space Grotesk' brings a computerized feel fitting to the app; 'Inter' ensures readability in longer blocks of text.
- Lucide icons to provide clear and consistent visual cues for actions and navigation.
- Use a clean and organized layout to ensure a user-friendly experience, with clear sections for different functionalities.
